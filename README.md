# Academic-Certificate-Verification-System
This project is a decentralized academic certificate verification system using blockchain with Proof-of-Authority consensus. It ensures secure, transparent credential issuance and instant verification through cryptographic signatures and immutable records. Registered institutions issue signed certificates stored in an immutable blockchain.
